# Eighties Wordle ReadME

## What is this?
I like to play wordle, and so I'm using it as an opportunity to make my own version. I'm stealing features from other games, and this is really just an exercise for me to learn and have fun.
## Why Eighties?
I'm calling it Eighties Wordle, because it's all text based.

## Design notes
I started this file to help me think through some design stuff, which in the end probably should have been more in pull requests. Oh well.
