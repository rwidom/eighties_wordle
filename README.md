# Eighties Wordle ReadME

## What is this?
I like to play wordle, and so I'm using it as an opportunity to make my own version. I'm stealing features from other games, and this is really just an exercise for me to learn and have fun.

## Where / how can I run it?
I've tested it on a mac (running MacOS Big Sur 11.6), and on an iPhone via pythonista.

I've used starting python in a directory called "eighties-wordle" as a standin for having all of the files needed for this program:
- ew_answer.py
- ew_config.py (just figures out whether to print things for an iphone or a mac)
- ew_display.py
- ew_guesses.py
- wordlist.txt

That's not the most user-friendly pythonic approach, but MVP and all that. :)
## Why Eighties?
I'm calling it Eighties Wordle, because it's all text based.
